/**
 * Regression guard for issue #2376:
 *   Hermes Agent crashes on every keypress because HERMES_HOME is unset
 *   in interactive sandbox shells, so proxy settings and Hermes runtime
 *   configuration from /tmp/nemoclaw-proxy-env.sh are missing.
 *
 * Root cause:
 *   The OpenClaw base image (Dockerfile.base) pre-creates /sandbox/.bashrc
 *   and /sandbox/.profile that source /tmp/nemoclaw-proxy-env.sh — the file
 *   the entrypoint writes with HERMES_HOME (and proxy vars) at runtime.
 *   The Hermes base image (agents/hermes/Dockerfile.base) was missing the
 *   equivalent block, so the proxy-env file existed but was never sourced.
 *
 *   The regression slipped in via #2297 which moved the proxy/HERMES_HOME
 *   exports out of an inline .bashrc append into the standalone proxy-env
 *   file — without realising the Hermes base image had no .bashrc to source it.
 *
 * Guard: assert agents/hermes/Dockerfile.base pre-creates both rc files
 * with the source line. The same guard exists implicitly for OpenClaw
 * (covered by test/e2e-gateway-isolation.sh).
