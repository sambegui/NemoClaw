# Get Started with NemoClaw on Brev (Web UI)

Run a sandboxed NemoClaw agent in minutes using the Brev web interface.
No CLI installation, no local setup, and no GPU required on your machine.

> **Note:** This guide covers the Brev web UI flow, which is the fastest way to try NemoClaw.
> If you prefer the CLI-based remote deployment, see Deploy to a Remote GPU Instance (use the `nemoclaw-user-deploy-remote` skill).

## Prerequisites

- An NVIDIA Brev account at [brev.nvidia.com](https://brev.nvidia.com)
- An NVIDIA API key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com)

No local software installation is needed.

## Get Your NVIDIA API Key

1. Go to [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com).
2. Sign in or create a free account.
3. Click your profile icon in the top right.
4. Select **API Keys**.
5. Click **Generate API Key**.
6. Copy the key -- it starts with `nvapi-`.

Keep this key ready for the next step.

## Deploy NemoClaw on Brev

1. Go to [brev.nvidia.com](https://brev.nvidia.com) and sign in.
2. On the **GPUs** page, look for the banner: **"Your agents are waiting. Meet NemoClaw"**.
3. Click **Try NemoClaw**.
4. The NemoClaw setup page shows the following:
   - Instance type: CPU (4 CPUs, 16 GiB RAM)
   - Cloud Provider: GCP
   - Cost: $0.18/hr
5. Click **Deploy NemoClaw**.

## Configure Your Agent

NemoClaw walks you through three configuration steps.

### Connect to AI

- **NVIDIA Cloud** is selected by default (recommended).
- This uses Nemotron-3-Super-120B hosted by NVIDIA.
- Paste your `nvapi-` API key in the field.
- Click **Create Agent**.

> **Note:** Other providers are available: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Local Ollama.
> Click **Show Other Providers** to see all options.

### Setup

NemoClaw automatically performs the following:

- Provisions a secure Linux VM on GCP.
- Installs Docker and the OpenShell runtime.
- Sets up the sandboxed agent environment.
- Configures inference routing to NVIDIA Cloud.

This takes approximately 2-3 minutes.

### Launch

When setup completes, the following confirmation appears:

```text
AGENT CREATED SUCCESSFULLY
Your agent is running in a secure sandbox and ready to use.

Agent: agent
Model: nemotron-3-super-120b
Provider: NVIDIA Cloud
```

Click **Chat With Agent** to open the OpenClaw gateway dashboard.

## Have Your First Conversation

In the Chat box, type the following:

```text
Hello! What can you do for me? What skills do you have available?
```

The agent reads its workspace files and introduces itself.
By default it has three skills available:

- **Weather** -- Get current weather and forecasts.
- **Healthcheck** -- Security audit and hardening.
- **Skill-Creator** -- Create new custom skills.

## Tell the Agent Who You Are

The agent starts with an empty `USER.md` file -- it knows nothing about you.
Update it so the agent personalizes its responses.

In the chat, type the following:

```text
Please update my USER.md file with the following:
Name: [your name]
Timezone: [your timezone, e.g. EST]
Notes: [what you are working on]
```

The agent writes this to your workspace so it remembers you across sessions.

## Stop Your Instance When Done

To avoid unnecessary charges, stop your instance when you are finished experimenting.

1. Go back to [brev.nvidia.com](https://brev.nvidia.com).
2. Click **GPUs** in the nav bar.
3. Find your NemoClaw instance.
4. Click **Stop**.

At $0.18/hr, a 3-hour session costs approximately $0.54.

## What to Try Next

Now that your agent is running, explore these capabilities.

**Connect a messaging channel.**
Go to **Channels** in the dashboard to connect your agent to Telegram, Slack, or Discord so it can message you proactively.

**Use a different AI model.**
The agent supports switching inference providers at runtime.
See Switch Inference Providers (use the `nemoclaw-user-configure-inference` skill) for instructions.

## Next Steps

- Prerequisites (use the `nemoclaw-user-get-started` skill) -- System requirements before getting started.
- Quickstart (use the `nemoclaw-user-get-started` skill) -- CLI-based local setup.
- Deploy to a Remote GPU Instance (use the `nemoclaw-user-deploy-remote` skill) -- CLI-based Brev deployment.
- Troubleshooting (use the `nemoclaw-user-reference` skill) -- Common issues and fixes.
- Monitor Sandbox Activity (use the `nemoclaw-user-monitor-sandbox` skill)
